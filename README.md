STRONG PASSWORD GENERATOR

ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION:
Passwords are very important for protecting data and personal information. A
strong password provides essential protection from financial fraud and identity
theft. This is the best form of security measure when it comes to preventing
the unauthorised access of one’s computer and mobile devices.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
With the explosion of social media websites and with more and more business
letting you do online transactions on the internet, it has become a problem to
protect the personal information from hackers and external threats. Strong
passwords are essential for securing the contents that are supposed to be
protected.

PROCEDURE:
The user can choose the length of the password, number of digits, letters and
special characters he/she wants. According to the user’s choice, the password
will be generated.
